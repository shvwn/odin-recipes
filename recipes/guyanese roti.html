<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups All purpose flour plus 1 cup for dusting</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon rapid rising yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup warm water (about 110°F)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup room temperature fat like vegan butter, ghee or oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup oil like sunflower, avocado or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar (to activate the yeast)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl add the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and rapid rising yeast, then whisk together until fully combined.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the warm water. Then Use a spatula to mix the water and flour together to form a soft dough ball</li>
    <li>Then cover the dough and let rest for 20-30 minutes. After the dough has rested for at least 20 minutes, divide the dough into 5 equal pieces</li>
    <li>On a floured surface roll the dough out until it is a thin (about 1/8 inch) flat disk. Next, add about 1 tablespoon of fat to the rolled out dough, rub the fat over the entire surface of the rolled out dough</li>
    <li>Then roll dough into a log. Next, Swirl the dough log around your finger to form a circular dough ball that looks like a cinnamon roll. Then tuck the loose end of the log into the bottom of the rolled up dough. Repeat for other 4 pieces of dough.</li>
    <li>Cover and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before moving to the next step.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, preheat a large skillet / tawah (traditional cast iron skillet for roti) on medium heat. Roll out one of the buttered roti doughs (oiled off roti) into a large thin disk, about ⅛ inch thickness (like a large tortilla)</li>
    <li>Place roti on the warm skillet or tawah. Cook until tiny bubbles / air pockets appear on the top of the roti (for about 30 seconds to 1 minute). Flip and brush with cooking oil and cook for another 30 seconds (or for as long as it will take to apply the oil)</li>
    <li>Flip again and apply oil to the other side. Cook for an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute, then remove from heat</li>
    <li>Clap the roti by placing the cooked roti on a flat surface. Fold the roti in half then push the roti into itself with your palms. Similar to compressing an accordion. Or keep it simple and put the roti in a covered bowl and shake to separate the layers and release the air pockets</li>
    <li>Serve your roti warm and with your favorite curry</li>
