        <p>This is one of my favorite go-to dishes when cooking for a large crowd, especially family gatherings. Fried rice and chow mein are a must have at most West Indian events. It feeds many and goes a long way. Fried rice is quite versatile as well; there are so many ways to change it up.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For Fried Rice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cup extra-long grain rice</li>
            <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped chinese long beans</li>

            <li>1/4 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3-4 scallion sprigs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mushroom sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chinese five spice</li>
            <li>5 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Protein</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of chicken or protein of your choice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cassareep</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon green seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil to cook chicken/protein</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice until the water is clear. Use a mesh colander to help make it easier. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook rice according to package directions, just until it is cooked and still has its shape. Be careful not to overcook it otherwise, it will be mushy. Drain rice until no more water is dripping. Spread in a long shallow pan. Let cool overnight or for a couple of hours. The rice should be completely cold before frying.</li>
            <li>Chop and prep all vegetables. Peel and finely dice carrots. Snip the ends of the bora beans and cut them into ¼ inch to ½ inch pieces. You can use pre-shredded cabbage or finely slice enough for 1 cup. Chop into smaller sizes. Dice the onions, crush and chop garlic cloves, and finely slice the scallions.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with olive oil, soy sauce, casareep, 2 tablespoons green seasoning, and a dash of salt. On medium temperature, heat a saute pan with 1 tablespoon of neutral oil. When oil is hot, add chicken and cook 10-15 minutes until browned, tossing every few minutes until most liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>  
            <li>Combine mushroom sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce in one bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a wok or kahari, add 1 tablespoon oil, saute onions, garlic, and ginger until onions are tender, 1-2 minutes. Then add carrots, and saute a few minutes.  Push carrots and other ingredients to the side of the wok and add 3 tablespoons of oil, then add bora and cabbage together. Saute 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add rice a little at a time tossing it with vegetables.  Add any other dry pantry seasonings you like at this point. Pour soy sauce mixture over rice and sprinkle Chinese five spice. Fry the rice until completely covered with sauce. </li>
            <li>Toss in the chicken and scallions and quickly toss to combine.</li>
        </ol>
